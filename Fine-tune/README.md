# Fine-tuning Methods Implementations
This repository contains the implementations of fine-tuning methods for neural networks. The methods are implemented. The repository is organized as follows:

1. Lora
    - Lora.py
    - Lora is a method that fine-tunes a neural network by minimizing the loss of the network on the training data and maximizing the loss of the network on the validation data.
